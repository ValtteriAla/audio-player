# Audio Player with Tkinter GUI

WIP. Need to find good audio library to play,stop,pause,resume audio (.mp3 formats should be enough).

General playlist functions seems to be working (play, pause, next, previous..)


### GPT audiolist:

- PyDub: PyDub is a simple and easy-to-use library for audio manipulation. It allows you to play, pause, and manipulate audio files in various formats.

- pygame: pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, but it also includes functions for playing and recording sound.

- pyaudio: pyaudio is a wrapper around PortAudio, which is a cross-platform audio I/O library. It allows you to play, record, and manipulate audio streams in Python.

- sounddevice: sounddevice is a Python library for playing and recording audio through PortAudio, similar to pyaudio but with a simpler interface.

- simpleaudio: simpleaudio is a simple cross-platform audio playback library for Python, which provides easy-to-use functions for playing audio files.

- audioplayer: audioplayer is a Python library specifically designed for playing audio files. It provides a simple interface for basic playback controls like play, pause, stop, etc.

From these the audioplayer seems to be the most promising
